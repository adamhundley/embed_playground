        Stranger Things is an American supernatural horror web television series created by the Duffer Brothers.[2] It is written and directed by Matt and Ross Duffer and executive-produced by Shawn Levy.[3] It stars Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Finn Wolfhard, Millie Bobby Brown, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Cara Buono, and Matthew Modine. The plot follows the disappearance of a young boy, and a telekinetic girl who helps his friends in their search, while the boy's older brother and the town police chief start their own investigations.[4][5]

        The show is set in 1980s Indiana and is an homage to '80s pop culture,[6] channeling the works of Steven Spielberg,[nb 1] John Carpenter,[nb 2] Stephen King,[nb 3] and George Lucas,[nb 4] among others.[nb 5][7]

        The show was released on Netflix on July 15, 2016. It received positive reviews for its characterization, pacing, atmosphere, acting, soundtrack, directing, writing, and homages to 1980s genre films.[8][9]

        Shortly after release discussion around a second season began, however there has been no official announcement so far that Stranger Things has been renewed.[10]
